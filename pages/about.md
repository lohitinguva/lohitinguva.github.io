# **About Me**

Hi, I’m **Lohit Inguva** 👋<br>
I’m a Cloud and Data Engineering professional with over **9 years of experience** designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native data platforms. My expertise spans across **AWS**, **Databricks**, **SAP Data Intelligence**, and modern data pipelines that enable advanced analytics, improve performance, and drive cost efficiencies.

I’ve successfully led projects involving **data warehouse modernization**, **automated quality frameworks**, and **real-time data pipelines** — helping teams shift from legacy infrastructure to modern, high-performing cloud ecosystems. I enjoy problem solving, working cross-functionally, and mentoring junior engineers.

Outside work, I’m a passionate about **cricket**, F1 enthusiast, and love exploring the outdoors with my family.
